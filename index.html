<p class="username">Natural muscle building: at home</p>
<p>The complete guide on how to build muscle at home. Here is a run down of all the tools I use to build muscle. Please see my detailed exercise guide, where I show you what exercises can be performed with each tool. As we are working with cheap and easy accessible weights, so many of these exercises can be mixed together for super-sets, and other variations to maximize muscle growth using basic equipment. 

I started off with cheap vinyl and sand filled weights for the first couple of months. Eventually I upgraded to iron plates as they are smaller and heavier than vinyl plates. That doesn`t mean that vinyl plates have no purpose tho, as they mix easily with iron plates on long curl bars, so long as they are the same diameter hole in the middle. I would never recommend using vinyl plates with dumbbells, as they wont be heavy enough for the large amount of real estate they use. Vinyl is typically twice the size, for just half the weight as iron. 

Dont just use Amazon as a resource! There are a few web sites which offer the same products at a cheaper price. Here in the UK, Mirafit and Argos have a range budget friendly bars which will do the job. Remember, the 1 inch bars fit the cheaper 1 inch hole diameter plates. Although the Olympic style bars maybe a better product, they use 2 inch plates which are expensive. Just make sure to get a solid bar, no join in the middle. In total my bars were about £30 each (without iron plates), the dumbbells are around £30 per set (including plates). There is no need to buy expensive benches either, as you can simply lift from laying on the floor, or even make a hookless floor bench.</p>

<img src="images/Dumbbells.jpg" alt="An image of narural muscle building" />
<p class="username">Dumbbells</p>So why train with dumbbells? Well, do you know those ancient Greek statues, the ones which depict men with peeled physiques, well guess what? they were all based on real physiques. So, its surprise that dumbbells can be traced back to 5th century BC to ancient Greece. The Greek version of the dumbbell was then called a haltere, an oblong-shaped stone with a handle. But if you need real life evidence of the muscle building power which the dumbbell has, then turn your attention to the early 1900s strongman, the father of modern-day bodybuilding, Eugen Sandow. Sandow himself drew inspiration from the ancient times and pioneered the light dumbbell training system to build his physique, way before any steroid was invented. Dumbbells are so versatile when it comes to the amount of exercise selection and are great for both compound and isolation use. <hr>

I have noticed that since the pandemic, retailers have increased the price of weights, both of my dumbbell sets were purchased about one year before the pandemic, and cost me around £20 for second hand ones, and £30 for new ones. The same weights from the same place now cost double the amount, so if you`re on a tight budget like me, then here’s a few things to look out for.

Il just get this out of the way first. The vinyl or plastic sand filled dumbbells won’t do at all, they are way too light and way too large, so don`t waste your money. And as I’m all about budgeting and making do with what I have, I won’t be shelling out for Olympic style bars and plates, and I certainly can’t afford single weighted dumbbells. Clearly my best choice is the commonly found 1 inch circumference bar, along with the interchangeable 1-inch holed plates. 
The typical budget cast iron dumbbell sets are usually similar to each other across various retailers and at car boot sales. They always seem to sell the basic `starter` set, the typical 1 inch bar with various plates, totalling 20kg. Some differences can be found however, such as having a spinlock bar, which uses a screwing lock mechanism on the collar, and a smooth collar bar, which uses a spring lock. The cast iron plates which came with my spinlock bars are shorter and wider than the plates which came with my smooth collar bar, but they weigh the same, and can be used on either of the bars, as they have the same 1-inch diameter hole. These sets are typically made up of a mixture of 4 x 2.5kg, 4 x 1.25kg, and 4 x 0.5kg plates, making 8.5kg per dumbbell. Each dumbbell weighs in at 10kg, including the bar.

Pretty soon you will be wanting to curl more than 10kg on each arm, but that’s when the price tag gets way out of my budgeting range, which is why I opted to buy a second set of second-hand dumbbells, as it was cheaper than buying separate plates online. By doing so, I could have 1 set of dumbbells, replacing the 4 x 0.5kg plates, with 4 x 2.5kg plates, so two dumbbells now have a safe maximum load of 12.5kg, 13.5kg including the bar. 
Now for the fun part, what exercises and variations can you do with dumbbells.</p>

<img src="images/Bench.jpg" alt="An image of narural muscle building" />
<p class="username">Bench</p>
<p>So this is the cheapest part of equipment. It is a floor bench, as it doesn't support any racking system for a barbell, instead, the bench press is handled by performing a pullover/scull crusher to get it into place. However, without missing an opportunity to super-set an exercise, i like to perform a set of skull-crushers, then straight into a set of presses, then lowering the weight back into a skull-crusher position to set it back down on the floor.

Seriously, this combination of exercises have become my bread and butter of muscle building.

The bench is made from a plank of wood, 36 inches in length, 9 inches width, and 1.5 inches thickness. Then using a sheet of foam taken from a chair, I covered the top, overlapping the edges. Then all is secured down with a roll of Gorilla tape. I have one chog of wood placed under it at the head end, providing the perfect angle and leverage to handle the bar.</p>

<img src="images/EZ Bar.jpg" alt="An image of narural muscle building" />
<p class="username">EZ Bar</p>
<p>The EZ curl bar, simply put, is just a variation of a standard straight curling bar. I prefer to use the EZ bar as its shorter than my straight bar. It is designed with a zigzag, creating several angles for hand placements along the bar. The angled hand positions on the bar help reduce strain on the wrists and elbows compared to a straight barbell, making it more comfortable for many people to perform exercises.

Although there are slight differences to be found in the curvature of the EZ bar, I find that the £30 one I found does the job. Generally speaking, the Olympic bars are heavier, and are better quality, but they cost more than double for a half decent quality one, not to mention the extra exspenese of the 2 inch holed plates. 

Dimensions. 48 inches total length. Cast iron weighing in at 5kg. 1 inch spring clips.

Bar diameter, 2.5cm, just shy of a 1 inch circumference. For use with 1 inch hole plates.

I can comfortably load 50kg in total, however this cast iron bar can handle up to 75kg, providing I use iron weights. As I am limited to the weights I have at home, I like use a mixture of iron, and the larger, yet lighter vinyl most of the time.</p>

<img src="images/Tricep bar.jpg" alt="An image of narural muscle building" />
<p class="username">Tricep Bar</p>
<p>The Tricep Bar is typically used to extend the arms, thus performing a tricep extension. However, this bar is so versatile that it can be used for a many different exercises. The tricep bar I use is made of steel, which is lighter than iron, but its still quite hefty. The design is structurally solid, it offers great stability under heavy load for hammer curls and close grip pressing, and because it can be loaded really heavy, performing rowing and pulling movements certainly etch out your obliques. Please refer to my detailed list of exercises where I teach you how to use this tool, and show you how to perform the many exercises it allows for.

A decent quality Tricep Bar for home bodybuilding such as the one I use is about £30. Just like all the equipment I use, it supports 1 inch plates. The only difference is the locking mechanism at each end. The Tricep Bar, just like all bars, come with some kind of locking devices. This Tricep Bar uses 1 inch spin lock collars. The bar is quite stubby in stature, as it is only 85cm in total length, with 20cm of its total length for each end for the weights to sit on. The bar is quite hefty, as it weighs in at 6.5KG.</p>

<img src="images/head-harness.jpg" alt="An image of narural muscle building" />
<p class="username">Head Harness</p>
<p>How to get a beefy neck. The neck trainer, or head harness is an adjustable head strap which allows you to load the chain with weights, to perform head nods from the comfort of your own home, where no one can see you.

All joking aside, when someone sees you with a massive muscular neck, they wont mess with you! Of course there are dangers to overloading any muscle, especially the neck, but that doesn't mean you cant train it. I am quite partial to laying down on my back and nodding 200 times, but I also like to load up 15kg on the head harness chain and perform standing head nods too.

Head harnesses vary in price, although they are all pretty cheap. The thing to look out for is the adjust-ability of the Velcro head strap, and if it includes a chin strap (unlike mine). I purchased one from eBay costing just £5. Better ones shouldn't cost you more than £10.</p>
