# buildmuscleathome2
an update with css bg colour
This is my first project for home learning. I wanted to create a web page about anything, 
so I decided to create one with my favourite hobby, which is muscle building at home on 
a budget. My web page will display jpg images along with a description of the equipment 
used, and where it can be sourced on a budget. The web site will later include pages of
"how 2" build muscle (Hypertrophy guide) with various exercises for the avarage man/woman.
Although I have nothing against people using PEDs, there is an emphasis on natural muscle 
building, bringing back the Bronze era strong man physique!
